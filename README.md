[*] pe-func-renamer.py
    # This script will generically rename a function within Hopper, if the Windows PE binary contains certain Windows API names 
    # identified by Hopper as imports. This is a "Hopper" port by Mick Grove (micksmix.wordpress.com) of Alexander Hanel's 
    # "func-renamer.py" script for IDA Pro.
